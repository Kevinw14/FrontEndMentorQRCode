## My process
My process was to get the card `<div>` in the middle of the overall webpage. Once that was accomplished I brought in the content of the card (`<img>`, `<p>`). I used flexbox to display the content of the card. Image on top and another `<div>` to house the `<p>` tags. I used flex-grow to push those `<p>` tags up to the image. Then used `.justify-between` to push the `<p>` tags apart. Last was cleaning up and styling it with font's, padding, and rounded the edges.
